<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

LEAD School is currently offering LEAD School@Home for all our partner schools parents. Your child can now attend live classes daily, attempt quizzes, ask doubts to their school teachers.

You can also join our LEAD School@Home program even if you are not part of a LEAD partner school, simply register your number and your child details to start your classes.
The LEAD School Student & Parent App allows parents of partner schools to track the progress of their child in school by keeping them updated on:
* Unit Progress: Know which units are completed and what your kid has learned.
* Attendance: Check your kids attendance in school for every day.
* Assessments: View reports on the student grade and scores by the student in different assessments.

We at Lead School define excellence as education that empowers students to be capable adults, responsible citizens and empathetic human beings. This is captured by our education mantra: LEARN.
